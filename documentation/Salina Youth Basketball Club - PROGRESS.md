# Salina Youth Basketball Club Website

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: A custom-built, mobile-first website for the Salina Youth Basketball Club to showcase teams, manage registrations, and engage parents, players, and external teams in central Kansas. Features include team schedules, tournament signups, merchandise sales, a Coaches Corner with AI-generated resources, and a Parent Portal, all with a sporty, cutting-edge, minimalistic dark theme.

**Tech Stack**:

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (auth, PostgreSQL, storage)
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Fulfillment**: Printful (print-on-demand for t-shirts)
- **UI Libraries**: Swiper.js (carousel), FullCalendar (schedules)
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Development**: Cursor (AI code editor)
- **Email**: Resend (transactional emails)

**Design**:

- Dark theme matching the club's logo
- **Primary Colors**: Navy (#1C2526), white (#FFFFFF), red (#D91E18)
- **Font**: Rubik (body), Inter (headings)
- **Layout**: Clean, minimalistic, with bold CTAs and card-based sections
- **Usability**: User-friendly for parents (register, view schedules, buy t-shirts), external teams (tournament signups), and coaches (update schedules), with a simple journey: explore club, register, manage team info.

**Cost Goal**: Minimal, leveraging free tiers (Supabase: 500 MB database, Vercel: Hobby plan, Stripe/Printful: pay-per-use, Resend: 100 emails/day) and open-source tools. Target budget: $20â€“$30/month.

**Documentation**: This file tracks progress, tasks, errors, and rules, shared with Grok in new conversation windows to maintain continuity across multi-session development in /salina-youth-basketball.

## Current State

**Date**: May 18, 2025, 05:51 PM CDT

**Progress**: Completed the Shop page build in Phase 3: Build Website, including `/app/shop/page.tsx`, `/app/shop/[category]/page.tsx`, `/app/shop/product/[id]/page.tsx`, `/app/shop/cart/page.tsx`, `/app/shop/checkout/page.tsx`, and `/app/shop/confirmation/page.tsx`. Implemented product listings, cart functionality, Stripe checkout flow, and order confirmation, styled with `bg-[#002C51]` background, `bg-gray-900` cards, `bg-blue-600` buttons, uppercase Rubik headings, and Inter body text. Resolved build errors: ESLint (`typescript-eslint`, `eslint-plugin-styled-jsx`), TypeScript (`cartItemCount` prop), `localStorage` SSR issues, and `useSearchParams` suspense errors. Successfully deployed to Vercel, with environment variables configured (Supabase, Stripe, Resend). Remaining Phase 3 task is building the Tournaments page. Phase 4 (Testing and Deployment) is in progress, with deployment complete and testing pending. Next task: Integrate Printful API for order fulfillment, ensuring orders placed on the website are successfully submitted to Printful.

**Blockers**: None.

**Errors**:

- [May 16, 2025]: No errors during Schedules page implementation. Fixed earlier FullCalendar CSS import issues by importing `main.css` in `/src/app/global.css`. Resolved mobile text overflow by hiding text in Month view and using colored blocks.
- [May 17, 2025]: Fixed `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` for merchandise images in `/app/teams/[id]/page.tsx` by correcting paths (e.g., `/images/team-thunderhawks-merch.jpg`).
- [May 17, 2025]: Resolved build errors: ESLint (`Cannot find package 'typescript-eslint'`) by installing `@typescript-eslint/parser` and `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`; TypeScript error in `/app/schedules/page.ts` by moving `events` and `teams` to `/src/lib/schedules/data.ts`.
- [May 18, 2025]: Fixed ESLint error (`Cannot find package 'eslint-plugin-styled-jsx'`) by removing the plugin from `eslint.config.mjs`, as Tailwind CSS is used instead of Styled JSX.
- [May 18, 2025]: Resolved build errors: `localStorage is not defined` in `/app/shop/cart/page.tsx` by moving `localStorage` access to `useEffect`; `useSearchParams` suspense error in `/app/shop/confirmation/page.tsx` by adding `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`; `metadataBase` warning by adding it to `/src/app/layout.tsx`.

## Prompts

### Start New Conversation with Grok

Hi Grok, I'm continuing work on the Salina Youth Basketball Club website in a new conversation window. Please review the attached PROGRESS.md file for the project's context, progress, and tasks. The site is a mobile-first, custom-built web app for managing youth basketball teams, using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Stripe, Printful, Resend, Vercel, and Cursor. The design is a dark theme (navy #1C2526, white #FFFFFF, red #D91E18; Rubik/Inter fonts), with a sporty, minimalistic layout for parents, teams, and coaches.

PROGRESS.md Contents:

[See attached PROGRESS.md]

Current Task:

Iâ€™m ready to integrate the Printful API to enable order fulfillment for the Shop page (`/app/shop/*`). The Shop page is complete with product listings, cart, Stripe checkout, and confirmation, deployed to Vercel. I need to ensure that when a user places an order (e.g., t-shirts for Thunderhawks, Firebolts), it is successfully submitted to Printful for fulfillment. Please discuss the Printful API integration, including authentication, required API endpoints (e.g., creating orders), data mapping from our checkout (`/app/shop/checkout/page.tsx`) to Printful, and any API routes needed (e.g., `/pages/api/printful-order.ts`). Highlight potential challenges (e.g., rate limits, error handling, product sync) and provide a plan to implement and test the integration.

Additional Context:

- The Shop page uses Stripe for payments (`/pages/api/stripe-payment.ts`) and Resend for emails (`/pages/api/send-email.ts`).
- Orders are confirmed in `/app/shop/confirmation/page.tsx` with data like `items` (productId, variantId, size, color, quantity), `subtotal`, `shippingCost`, `totalPrice`, and `shippingAddress` (fullName, street, city, state, zip, country).
- Printful will handle t-shirt fulfillment (e.g., `/images/team-thunderhawks-merch.jpg` products).
- Refer to Printful API Docs (https://www.printful.com/api) for endpoints and authentication.
- Use cost-minimal approaches (e.g., Printfulâ€™s pay-per-use model).
- Style any new UI (e.g., error messages) to match the dark theme (`bg-[#002C51]`, `bg-gray-900` cards, `bg-blue-600` buttons).
- Update `PROGRESS.md` with task completion and status after each response.
- Ensure compliance with `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (e.g., `styling-rules.mdc` for Tailwind).

Please provide a detailed plan for Printful API integration, then proceed with implementing necessary code (e.g., API routes, checkout updates). Let me know if you need specific files (e.g., `/app/shop/checkout/page.tsx`, `/pages/api/stripe-payment.ts`) or clarification.
