# Salina Youth Basketball Club Website

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: A custom-built, mobile-first website for the Salina Youth Basketball Club to showcase teams, manage registrations, and engage parents, players, and external teams in central Kansas. Features include team schedules, tournament signups, merchandise sales, a Coaches Corner with AI-generated resources, and a Parent Portal, all with a sporty, cutting-edge, minimalistic dark theme.

**Tech Stack**:

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (auth, PostgreSQL, storage)
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Fulfillment**: Printful (print-on-demand for t-shirts)
- **UI Libraries**: Swiper.js (carousel), FullCalendar (schedules)
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Development**: Cursor (AI code editor)

**Design**:

- Dark theme matching the club's logo
- **Primary Colors**: Navy (#1C2526), white (#FFFFFF), red (#D91E18)
- **Font**: Rubik (body), Inter (headings)
- **Layout**: Clean, minimalistic, with bold CTAs and card-based sections
- **Usability**: User-friendly for parents (register, view schedules, buy t-shirts), external teams (tournament signups), and coaches (update schedules), with a simple journey: explore club, register, manage team info.

**Cost Goal**: Minimal, leveraging free tiers (Supabase: 500 MB database, Vercel: Hobby plan, Stripe/Printful: pay-per-use) and open-source tools. Target budget: $20â€“$30/month.

**Documentation**: This file tracks progress, tasks, errors, and rules, shared with Grok in new conversation windows to maintain continuity across multi-session development in /salina-youth-basketball.

## Current State

**Date**: May 14, 2025, 05:29 PM CDT

**Progress**: Continued Phase 3: Build Website. The Join page (/join, /join/confirm, /join/status) is fully implemented with form submission, Stripe payment integration, Supabase storage, and PDF invoice generation. However, the latest build failed due to an invalid revalidate export in src/app/join/status/page.tsx and a missing eslint-plugin-next package, preventing a successful deployment to Vercel. Previous errors (e.g., TypeScript issues, ESLint react/react-in-jsx-scope, Styled JSX properties) have been resolved by installing packages (typescript-eslint, eslint-plugin-styled-jsx), disabling unnecessary rules, and adding null checks. The project is deployed at https://wcs-three.vercel.app/, but the Join page functionality needs to be fully tested and verified on Vercel.

**Blockers**: Build failure due to invalid revalidate export and missing eslint-plugin-next package.

**Environment**: Local folder (C:\Users\phron\OneDrive\Documents\HTML CSS JS Projects\World Class Sports\salina-youth-basketball); GitHub (https://github.com/your-username/salina-youth-basketball); Supabase (created); Vercel (deployed); Cursor (paid plan assumed).

**Errors**:

- [May 14, 2025]: Build failed with Invalid revalidate value error in src/app/join/status/page.tsx due to a misinterpreted revalidate export, and missing eslint-plugin-next package in eslint.config.mjs.

- [ ] Build Schedules Page

**Explanation**: This page will display a full schedule of games for all teams, using the FullCalendar library for an interactive calendar view. The schedule will pull static data initially (e.g., from the 20-team dataset) and later integrate with Supabase for dynamic updates by coaches. The page should include filters for teams and age groups, styled consistently with the project's dark theme (navy background #002C51, dark cards #01182B, white text #FFFFFF, Rubik for headings, Inter for body text). A "Back to Homepage" link will ensure navigation consistency.

- [ ] Create app/schedules/page.tsx with FullCalendar integration

**Explanation**: Implement the FullCalendar library to render an interactive calendar showing game schedules. Use static data from the 20-team dataset (e.g., games from TeamPreview.tsx) to populate events, including date, teams, and location. Add filters (e.g., dropdowns for team and age group) to allow users to view specific schedules.

- [ ] Style the page to match the project's design

**Explanation**: Apply the project's dark theme and typography (navy background, white text, Rubik/Inter fonts). Use Tailwind CSS classes for layout (e.g., grid, flex) and styling (e.g., bg-[#002C51], text-[#FFFFFF], font-rubik). Ensure the calendar and filters are responsive across mobile and desktop.

- [ ] Add navigation links (e.g., "Back to Homepage")

**Explanation**: Include a navigation link to return to the homepage (/) using Next.js Link component, styled as a button or text link to maintain consistency with other pages (e.g., text-[#FFFFFF] hover:text-[#E6ECEF]).

- [ ] Test locally to ensure functionality and styling

**Explanation**: Run npm run dev to test the page locally, verifying that the calendar renders correctly, filters work, and the layout is responsive. Check for any console errors or styling issues.

- [ ] Build Shop Page

**Explanation**: This page will serve as an e-commerce section for selling merchandise (e.g., t-shirts) using Printful for print-on-demand fulfillment and Stripe for payments. Initially, it will display static product listings (e.g., t-shirt designs from placeholder content) with a "Buy Now" button linking to a checkout flow. The page will be styled to match the project's design, with product cards and a cart summary. Future iterations will integrate Printful's API for dynamic products and order fulfillment.

- [ ] Create app/shop/page.tsx with static product listings

**Explanation**: Build a grid of product cards displaying static t-shirt designs (e.g., from placeholder content). Each card should show the product image, name, price, and a "Buy Now" button. Use static data initially, with plans to integrate Printful API later.

- [ ] Implement a basic checkout flow with Stripe

**Explanation**: Add a simple checkout flow using Stripe Elements (similar to the Join page) to handle payments for t-shirt purchases. Include a cart summary and a form for billing/shipping details, redirecting to a success page upon payment completion.

- [ ] Style the page to match the project's design

**Explanation**: Apply the project's dark theme and typography (navy background, white text, Rubik/Inter fonts). Use Tailwind CSS classes for product cards (e.g., bg-[#01182B], rounded-[1rem], shadow) and the checkout form (e.g., bg-[#FFFFFF], text-[#0A0F15] for inputs). Ensure responsiveness across devices.

- [ ] Add navigation links (e.g., "Back to Homepage")

**Explanation**: Include a navigation link to return to the homepage (/) using Next.js Link component, styled consistently with other pages (e.g., text-[#FFFFFF] hover:text-[#E6ECEF]).

- [ ] Test locally to ensure functionality and styling

**Explanation**: Run npm run dev to test the page locally, verifying that product listings display correctly, the checkout flow works with Stripe test cards (e.g., 4242 4242 4242 4242), and the layout is responsive. Check for any console errors or styling issues.

- [ ] Build Tournaments Page

**Explanation**: This page will allow external teams to sign up for tournaments hosted by the club, integrating with TourneyMachine for tournament management. Initially, it will include a static list of upcoming tournaments and a signup form for external teams, storing submissions in Supabase. The page will be styled to match the project's design, with tournament cards and a form section. Future iterations will fully integrate TourneyMachine API for real-time tournament data.

- [ ] Create app/tournaments/page.tsx with static tournament listings

**Explanation**: Build a list of upcoming tournaments using static data (e.g., tournament names, dates, locations). Display each tournament as a card with a "Sign Up" button linking to a signup form on the same page. Use static data initially, with plans to integrate TourneyMachine API later.

- [ ] Implement a signup form for external teams with Supabase storage

**Explanation**: Add a form for external teams to sign up, collecting details like team name, age group, coach name, and contact info. Store submissions in a Supabase table (tournament_signups) using the Supabase client (similar to the Join page). Include form validation and error handling.

- [ ] Style the page to match the project's design

**Explanation**: Apply the project's dark theme and typography (navy background, white text, Rubik/Inter fonts). Use Tailwind CSS classes for tournament cards (e.g., bg-[#01182B], rounded-[1rem], shadow) and the signup form (e.g., bg-[#FFFFFF], text-[#0A0F15] for inputs). Ensure responsiveness across devices.

- [ ] Add navigation links (e.g., "Back to Homepage")

**Explanation**: Include a navigation link to return to the homepage (/) using Next.js Link component, styled consistently with other pages (e.g., text-[#FFFFFF] hover:text-[#E6ECEF]).

- [ ] Test locally to ensure functionality and styling

**Explanation**: Run npm run dev to test the page locally, verifying that tournament listings display correctly, the signup form submits data to Supabase, and the layout is responsive. Check for any console errors or styling issues.

- [ ] Deploy updates to Vercel
