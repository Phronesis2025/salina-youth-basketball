# Project Progress: Salina Youth Basketball Club Website

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: A custom-built, mobile-first website for the Salina Youth Basketball Club to showcase teams, manage registrations, and engage parents, players, and external teams in central Kansas. Features include team schedules, tournament signups, merchandise sales, a Coaches Corner with AI-generated resources, and a Parent Portal, all with a sporty, cutting-edge, minimalistic dark theme.

**Tech Stack**:

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (auth, PostgreSQL, storage)
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Fulfillment**: Printful (print-on-demand for t-shirts)
- **UI Libraries**: Swiper.js (carousel), FullCalendar (schedules)
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Development**: Cursor (AI code editor)

**Design**: Dark theme matching the club’s logo:

- **Primary Colors**: Navy (`#1C2526`), white (`#FFFFFF`), red (`#D91E18`)
- **Font**: Montserrat (body), Bebas Neue (headings)
- **Layout**: Clean, minimalistic, with bold CTAs and card-based sections

**Usability**: User-friendly for parents (register, view schedules, buy t-shirts), external teams (tournament signups), and coaches (update schedules), with a simple journey: explore club, register, manage team info.

**Cost Goal**: Minimal, leveraging free tiers (Supabase: 500 MB database, Vercel: Hobby plan, Stripe/Printful: pay-per-use) and open-source tools. Target budget: $20–$30/month.

**Documentation**: This file tracks progress, tasks, errors, and rules, shared with Grok in new conversation windows to maintain continuity across multi-session development in `/salina-youth-basketball`.

## Current State

- **Date**: May 13, 2025
- **Progress**: Continued Phase 3: Build Website. Confirmed layout structure (Navbar, Footer) renders correctly. Decided to use inline Tailwind color codes (`bg-[#D91E18]`, `text-[#FFFFFF]`) instead of custom color classes (`bg-accent`, `text-text`) due to persistent issues with Tailwind v4 custom colors, even after safelist attempts. Built the Homepage Hero section (`Hero.tsx`) with a video placeholder, heading, and three CTAs, styled with inline colors (navy background, white text, red buttons). Updated `page.tsx` to include the Hero section.
- **Blockers**: None
- **Environment**: Local folder (`/salina-youth-basketball`); GitHub (`https://github.com/your-username/salina-youth-basketball`); Supabase (to be created); Vercel (to be deployed); Cursor (paid plan assumed).
- **Errors**:
  - [May 13, 2025]: `bg-accent` class not applying with Tailwind v4, even after safelist. Resolved by using inline colors (`bg-[#D91E18]`). Decided not to downgrade to Tailwind v3, per user preference.
- **Date**: May 13, 2025
- **Progress**: Resolved shadcn/ui Button rendering issue in `Hero.tsx`. The buttons ("Sign Up", "Schedules", "Tournaments") now match the `btn-neutral` style (bg-[#FFFFFF], text-[#0A0F15], px-[16px] py-[8px], rounded-[0.25rem], hover:bg-[#E6ECEF], shadow, Rubik font). Issue was due to inherited `text-[#FFFFFF]` from parent section overriding button text color, and browser default `a:-webkit-any-link` styles. Fixed by applying `text-[#0A0F15]` directly on `Button` and using `no-underline` on `Link`. Reverted to Tailwind classes for background and hover effects.
- **Blockers**: None
- **Environment**: Local folder (`/salina-youth-basketball`); GitHub (`https://github.com/your-username/salina-youth-basketball`); Supabase (to be created); Vercel (to be deployed); Cursor (paid plan assumed).
- **Errors**:
  - [May 13, 2025]: shadcn/ui Button in `Hero.tsx` not rendering `btn-neutral` style (transparent background, wrong text color). Resolved by using inline styles initially, then reverting to Tailwind classes with proper specificity and `no-underline` on links.
- **Date**: May 13, 2025
- **Progress**: Updated `Hero.tsx` to fix the "Tournaments" button, which wasn’t a link. Converted it to a shadcn/ui `Button` with a `Link` to `/tournaments`, matching the other buttons. Also fixed button alignment to always be in one row by changing `flex flex-col md:flex-row` to `flex flex-row flex-wrap`. Buttons now render correctly with the `btn-neutral` style. Next task: Build the News Carousel for the Homepage.

- **Errors**: None
- **Date**: May 13, 2025
- **Progress**: Updated `Navbar.tsx` to match the functionality of a sample navbar. Added a scroll effect to shrink the navbar width (from 95% to 80%), logo size, and nav link sizes when scrolled (`window.scrollY > 10`). Kept `DropdownMenu` for mobile navigation (instead of `Sheet`, which was missing) to display a vertical menu. Replaced "Login" and "Register" buttons with a single "Get Started" button. Styled the navbar to match the Hero section (navy background `#002C51`, white text `#FFFFFF`, Rubik font for links, Inter font for buttons). Next task: Build the News Carousel for the Homepage.

- **Errors**: None
- **Date**: May 13, 2025
- **Progress**: Further updated `Navbar.tsx`. Replaced "Salina Basketball" text with the logo (`/images/WCS Logo-transparentBG.png`). Removed the `DropdownMenu` for mobile navigation, making the links visible on all screen sizes. Right-aligned the links ("Teams", "Schedules", "Shop", "Join the Team") with small text (`text-sm`) and Inter font (`font-inter`). Styled "Join the Team" to match the Hero section’s CTA buttons (`bg-[#FFFFFF] text-[#0A0F15] hover:bg-[#E6ECEF]`), while other links have no background. Updated navbar background to black (`bg-[black]`) and adjusted padding and sizes for consistency. Next task: Build the News Carousel for the Homepage.

- **Errors**: None
- **Date**: May 13, 2025
- **Progress**: Built the Homepage News Carousel in `NewsCarousel.tsx` using Swiper.js. Added static news items with titles, dates, images, descriptions, and detailed content. Each news item is displayed as a card in a responsive carousel (1 slide on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on desktop) with navigation arrows and pagination. Added a "Read More" button to open a custom modal (using state and Tailwind) with full details, as the shadcn/ui `Dialog` component was not confirmed to be installed. Styled the carousel to match the Hero section (navy background `#002C51`, white text `#FFFFFF`, Rubik font for headings, Inter font for body text). Integrated `NewsCarousel` into `page.tsx` below the Hero section. Next task: Add team/schedule previews and other Homepage sections.

- **Errors**: None
- **Date**: May 14, 2025
- **Progress**: Refined the styling of news cards in `NewsCarousel.tsx` to align with the project’s sporty, minimalistic design. Updated cards to have a dark background (`#01182B`), rounded corners, subtle shadow, and a hover effect (scale up and enhanced shadow). Styled the title as uppercase with Rubik font, date and description with Inter font, and the "Read More" button to match the Hero section’s CTAs (`bg-[#FFFFFF] text-[#0A0F15] uppercase`). Ensured consistency with the project’s dark theme and typography. Next task: Add team/schedule previews and other Homepage sections.

- **Errors**: None
- **Date**: May 14, 2025
- **Progress**: Updated `Hero.tsx` to adjust the overlay color to `bg-[black] opacity-[70%]`, matching the navbar’s background. Modified the title’s size to `text-[clamp(4rem,5vw,4rem)]` for consistency across devices, and the subtitle’s size to `text-[clamp(1.5rem,2vw,15rem)]` (noting the max value may be a typo, possibly intended as `1.5rem`). Tightened subtitle spacing with `mb-[8px]`. Updated `NewsCarousel.tsx` to add TypeScript interfaces for news items, improving type safety. Adjusted the modal overlay to `bg-[black]`, increased container padding to `px-16`, and refined card spacing and layout with `flex` for consistent height and button positioning. Fixed shadcn/ui components by ensuring Tailwind CSS is properly included in `global.css`. Next task: Add team/schedule previews and other Homepage sections.

- **Date**: May 14, 2025
- **Progress**: Added team and schedule preview sections to the Homepage. Created `TeamPreview.tsx` to display three teams (Thunderhawks, Firebolts, Stingers) with images, names, age groups, and a "Learn More" button linking to individual team pages. Created `SchedulePreview.tsx` to show upcoming games (Thunderhawks vs. Eagles, Firebolts vs. Tigers, Stingers vs. Wolves) with dates, teams, locations, and a "View Details" button linking to the full schedule. Added `ValuesSection.tsx` to highlight the club’s core values (Teamwork, Excellence, Inspiration). Styled all sections to match the project’s design (navy background `#002C51`, dark cards `#01182B`, white text `#FFFFFF`, Rubik for headings, Inter for body text, uppercase titles). Integrated sections into `page.tsx` below the News Carousel. Homepage sections are now complete.

- **Date**: May 14, 2025
- **Progress**: Built the Team Hub in `app/teams/page.tsx`. Added a list of all teams with details (name, age group, coach, image) using static data. Implemented a filter dropdown to sort teams by age group (All, U-10, U-12, U-14, U-16). Each team card links to an individual Team Sub-Page (to be built). Styled the Team Hub to match the project’s design (navy background `#002C51`, dark cards `#01182B`, white text `#FFFFFF`, Rubik for headings, Inter for body text, uppercase titles). Added a "Back to Homepage" button. Next task: Build the Team Sub-Page.

- **Progress**: Built the Team Sub-Page in `app/teams/[id]/page.tsx`. Added a dynamic page to display detailed team information (name, age group, coach, roster, schedule, coach bio, gallery) using static data. Included sections for team overview, coach bio, roster, schedule, and gallery, with a "Back to Team Hub" button. Styled the page to match the project’s design (navy background `#002C51`, dark cards `#01182B`, white text `#FFFFFF`, Rubik for headings, Inter for body text, uppercase titles). Added error handling for invalid team IDs. Next task: Deploy updates to Vercel.

- **Progress**: Deployed the Salina Youth Basketball Club website to Vercel. Pushed the project to a GitHub repository (`salina-youth-basketball`), imported it into Vercel, and deployed it successfully. The site is now live at a Vercel-provided URL (e.g., `https://salina-youth-basketball.vercel.app`). Configured automatic deployments for future updates via Git. Tested key features (Homepage, Team Hub, Team Sub-Page) to ensure they work as expected. Next task: Commit changes to GitHub and update `PROGRESS.md` with Phase 3 status.

- **Errors**: None
- **Date**: May 14, 2025
- **Progress**: Resolved build warnings and errors identified during `npm run build`. Fixed custom font loading by preloading fonts in `layout.tsx` with `<link>` tags to prevent FOUT. Replaced all `<img>` tags with `<Image />` from `next/image` in `Navbar.tsx`, `NewsCarousel.tsx`, `TeamPreview.tsx`, `app/teams/page.tsx`, and `app/teams/[id]/page.tsx` to optimize image loading and improve LCP. Removed unused `colors` variable in `Navbar.tsx` to fix TypeScript error (`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`). Successfully built the project with no warnings or errors. Next task: Commit changes to GitHub and update `PROGRESS.md` with Phase 3 status.

- **Date**: May 14, 2025
- **Progress**: Fixed additional build errors and warnings identified during `npm run build`. Resolved custom font warning by switching to `next/font/google` in `layout.tsx` to load Rubik and Inter fonts, ensuring global font application and eliminating FOUT. Updated `global.css` to remove Google Fonts import and use CSS variables for font classes. Fixed JSX syntax errors in `app/teams/[id]/page.tsx` by replacing unescaped single quotes with curly quotes in the "Team Not Found" message. Successfully built the project with no errors. Next task: Commit changes to GitHub and update `PROGRESS.md` with Phase 3 status.

- **Errors**: None
- **Date**: May 14, 2025
- **Progress**: Fixed styling issue on Vercel deployment where no styles were applied. Identified the root cause as a missing `import './global.css'` in `layout.tsx`, which prevented Tailwind CSS styles from being included in the build. Added the import and redeployed to Vercel with a cleared build cache. Verified that styling is now applied correctly (navbar, Hero section, cards, fonts). Ensured `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` are correctly configured to process Tailwind styles. Next task: Commit changes to GitHub and update `PROGRESS.md` with Phase 3 status.

- **Errors**: None
- **Date**: May 14, 2025
- **Progress**: Resolved build failure due to missing `global.css` and permission issues. Fixed `Module not found: Can't resolve './global.css'` by ensuring `global.css` exists in `src/app/` and is correctly imported in `layout.tsx`. Resolved `EPERM: operation not permitted` error by moving the project out of OneDrive to `C:\Users\phron\Documents\salina-youth-basketball`, preventing file locking during builds. Successfully built the project locally and redeployed to Vercel. Confirmed that styles are now applied correctly on Vercel by verifying the presence of a CSS file in the Network tab. Next task: Commit changes to GitHub and update `PROGRESS.md` with Phase 3 status.

- **Errors**: None
- **Date**: May 14, 2025
- **Progress**: Fixed PostCSS configuration errors during `npm run build`. Installed `@tailwindcss/postcss` as required by Tailwind CSS 4 and updated `postcss.config.js` to use the new plugin. Ensured `postcss.config.js` exports a `plugins` key to resolve the "Your custom PostCSS configuration must export a `plugins` key" error. Successfully built the project locally after moving it out of OneDrive to prevent permission issues. Redeployed to Vercel and confirmed that styles are now applied. Next task: Commit changes to GitHub and update `PROGRESS.md` with Phase 3 status.
- **Blockers**: None
- **Environment**: Local folder (`C:\Users\phron\Documents\salina-youth-basketball`); GitHub (`https://github.com/your-username/salina-youth-basketball`); Supabase (to be created); Vercel (deployed); Cursor (paid plan assumed).
- **Errors**: None
- **Date**: May 14, 2025
- **Progress**: Resolved TypeScript module error in `join/page.tsx` during `npm run build`. Ensured all placeholder pages (`signup`, `schedules`, `shop`, `tournaments`, `join`) correctly export default components, making them recognizable as modules. Cleaned the build cache and verified `tsconfig.json` settings for proper module resolution. Successfully built the project locally and redeployed to Vercel. Confirmed that styles are applied and 404 errors for routes are resolved. Next task: Commit changes to GitHub and update `PROGRESS.md` with Phase 3 status.
- **Blockers**: None

- **Date**: May 14, 2025
- **Progress**: Successfully deployed to Vercel with styles applied. Resolved 404 errors for routes `/signup`, `/schedules`, `/shop`, `/tournaments`, and `/join` by adding placeholder pages. Fixed logo and footer not displaying by updating the logo path in `Navbar.tsx` to `/images/WCS-Logo-transparentBG.png` (removing spaces) and ensuring `Footer.tsx` is included in `layout.tsx`. Verified that the logo, footer, and all styles (navy background `#002C51`, white text `#FFFFFF`, Rubik/Inter fonts) are correctly displayed on Vercel. Next task: Proceed to Phase 4 (testing and deployment refinements).

- **Errors**: None
- **Date**: May 14, 2025
- **Progress**: Fixed logo shrinking issue in `Navbar.tsx`. The logo was not resizing on scroll due to fixed `width` and `height` props in the `Image` component. Implemented an alternative solution by using CSS (`w-full h-full`) to scale the image within a parent `div` that adjusts its dimensions (`h-[60px] w-[150px]` to `h-[45px] w-[112.5px]`) based on the `scrolled` state, maintaining the aspect ratio. Redeployed to Vercel and confirmed that the logo now shrinks correctly when the user scrolls. Phase 3 is fully complete. Next task: Proceed to Phase 4 (testing and deployment refinements).

## Prompts

### Start New Conversation with Grok

Hi Grok, I’m continuing work on the Salina Youth Basketball Club website in a new conversation window. Please review the attached `PROGRESS.md` file for the project’s context, progress, and tasks. The site is a mobile-first, custom-built web app for managing youth basketball teams, using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Stripe, Printful, Vercel, and Cursor. The design is a dark theme (navy `#1C2526`, white `#FFFFFF`, red `#D91E18`; Montserrat/Bebas Neue fonts), with a sporty, minimalistic layout for parents, teams, and coaches.

**PROGRESS.md Contents**:  
[See attached `PROGRESS.md`]

**Current Task**:  
[Specify task, e.g., “Set up Next.js project with Tailwind CSS”, “Build Homepage Hero section”]

**Additional Context**:

- Refer to `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files for AI coding rules (e.g., `styling-rules.mdc` for Tailwind).
- Ensure code aligns with the dark, sporty design and user-friendly journey.
- Use cost-minimal approaches (e.g., free tiers for Supabase/Vercel).
- Update `PROGRESS.md` with task completion and status after each response.

Please provide the requested code, review, or guidance, and suggest how to update `PROGRESS.md` to reflect this work. Let me know if you need specific files or clarification.
