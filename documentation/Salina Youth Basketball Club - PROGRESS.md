# Salina Youth Basketball Club Website

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: A custom-built, mobile-first website for the Salina Youth Basketball Club to showcase teams, manage registrations, and engage parents, players, and external teams in central Kansas. Features include team schedules, tournament signups, merchandise sales, a Coaches Corner with AI-generated resources, and a Parent Portal, all with a sporty, cutting-edge, minimalistic dark theme.

**Tech Stack**:

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (auth, PostgreSQL, storage)
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Fulfillment**: Printful (print-on-demand for t-shirts)
- **UI Libraries**: Swiper.js (carousel), FullCalendar (schedules)
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Development**: Cursor (AI code editor)
- **Email**: Resend (transactional emails)

**Design**:

- Dark theme matching the club's logo
- **Primary Colors**: Navy (#1C2526), white (#FFFFFF), red (#D91E18)
- **Font**: Rubik (body), Inter (headings)
- **Layout**: Clean, minimalistic, with bold CTAs and card-based sections
- **Usability**: User-friendly for parents (register, view schedules, buy t-shirts), external teams (tournament signups), and coaches (update schedules), with a simple journey: explore club, register, manage team info.

**Cost Goal**: Minimal, leveraging free tiers (Supabase: 500 MB database, Vercel: Hobby plan, Stripe/Printful: pay-per-use, Resend: 100 emails/day) and open-source tools. Target budget: $20â€“$30/month.

**Documentation**: This file tracks progress, tasks, errors, and rules, shared with Grok in new conversation windows to maintain continuity across multi-session development in /salina-youth-basketball.

## Current State

**Date**: May 20, 2025, 02:31 PM CDT

**Progress**: Completed the Printful API integration for order fulfillment in Phase 3: Build Website. Implemented `/pages/api/create-printful-order.ts` to submit orders to Printful, mapping checkout data (`items`, `subtotal`, `shippingAddress`, `customerEmail`) to Printful's order format. Updated `/app/shop/checkout/CheckoutPage.tsx` to handle order submission and error logging. Resolved issues with `isTestMode` logic, ensuring test mode works in production (`?test=true` creates draft orders). Fixed Printful API errors: incorrect confirmation endpoint (`/v2/orders/@confirm` to `/orders/{id}/confirm`), missing API keys in Vercel, and client-side error handling mismatches. Successfully tested order submission in both test mode (draft orders in Printful) and live mode (confirmed orders), with proper logging in Supabase `orders` and `logs` tables. Deployed a fully working version to Vercel at `https://wcs-three.vercel.app`, with environment variables (`PRINTFUL_TEST_API_KEY`, `PRINTFUL_API_KEY`) configured. Remaining Phase 3 task is building the Tournaments page. Phase 4 (Testing and Deployment) is in progress, with deployment complete and initial testing of the Shop page successful. Next task: Build the Tournaments page and continue end-to-end testing of all flows (registration, schedules, purchases).

**Blockers**: None.

**Errors**:

- [May 16, 2025]: No errors during Schedules page implementation. Fixed earlier FullCalendar CSS import issues by importing `main.css` in `/src/app/global.css`. Resolved mobile text overflow by hiding text in Month view and using colored blocks.
- [May 17, 2025]: Fixed `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` for merchandise images in `/app/teams/[id]/page.tsx` by correcting paths (e.g., `/images/team-thunderhawks-merch.jpg`).
- [May 17, 2025]: Resolved build errors: ESLint (`Cannot find package 'typescript-eslint'`) by installing `@typescript-eslint/parser` and `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`; TypeScript error in `/app/schedules/page.ts` by moving `events` and `teams` to `/src/lib/schedules/data.ts`.
- [May 18, 2025]: Fixed ESLint error (`Cannot find package 'eslint-plugin-styled-jsx'`) by removing the plugin from `eslint.config.mjs`, as Tailwind CSS is used instead of Styled JSX.
- [May 18, 2025]: Resolved build errors: `localStorage is not defined` in `/app/shop/cart/page.tsx` by moving `localStorage` access to `useEffect`; `useSearchParams` suspense error in `/app/shop/confirmation/page.tsx` by adding `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`; `metadataBase` warning by adding it to `/src/app/layout.tsx`.
- [May 19, 2025]: Resolved Printful API integration errors: `Property 'source' is required` by adding `source: "api"` to the payload and updating the endpoint to `/orders` (removing `/v2`); `There can only be one file for each placement` by sending a single file in the `files` array; missing API keys by setting `PRINTFUL_TEST_API_KEY` and `PRINTFUL_API_KEY` in Vercel; incorrect test mode logic by updating `isTestMode` to rely solely on `searchParams` in `/app/shop/checkout/CheckoutPage.tsx`.
- [May 20, 2025]: Fixed Printful order confirmation error: 404 on `/v2/orders/@confirm` by updating to the correct endpoint `/orders/{id}/confirm` in `/pages/api/create-printful-order.ts`. Resolved client-side error ("contact support") by ensuring the server handles confirmation failures gracefully and the client receives the correct response.

## Prompts

### Start New Conversation with Grok

Hi Grok, I'm continuing work on the Salina Youth Basketball Club website in a new conversation window. Please review the attached PROGRESS.md file for the project's context, progress, and tasks. The site is a mobile-first, custom-built web app for managing youth basketball teams, using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Stripe, Printful, Resend, Vercel, and Cursor. The design is a dark theme (navy #1C2526, white #FFFFFF, red #D91E18; Rubik/Inter fonts), with a sporty, minimalistic layout for parents, teams, and coaches.

PROGRESS.md Contents:

[See attached PROGRESS.md]

Current Task:

[Insert current task here, e.g., building the Tournaments page or testing end-to-end flows.]

Additional Context:

- The Shop page uses Stripe for payments (`/pages/api/stripe-payment.ts`) and Resend for emails (`/pages/api/send-email.ts`).
- Orders are confirmed in `/app/shop/confirmation/page.tsx` with data like `items` (productId, variantId, size, color, quantity), `subtotal`, `shippingCost`, `totalPrice`, and `shippingAddress` (fullName, street, city, state, zip, country).
- Printful handles t-shirt fulfillment (e.g., `/images/team-thunderhawks-merch.jpg` products).
- Refer to Printful API Docs (https://www.printful.com/api) for endpoints and authentication.
- Use cost-minimal approaches (e.g., Printfulâ€™s pay-per-use model).
- Style any new UI (e.g., error messages) to match the dark theme (`bg-[#002C51]`, `bg-gray-900` cards, `bg-blue-600` buttons).
- Update `PROGRESS.md` with task completion and status after each response.
- Ensure compliance with `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (e.g., `styling-rules.mdc` for Tailwind).

Please provide a detailed plan for the current task, then proceed with implementing necessary code. Let me know if you need specific files or clarification.
