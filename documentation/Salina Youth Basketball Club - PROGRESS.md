# Salina Youth Basketball Club Website

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: A custom-built, mobile-first website for the Salina Youth Basketball Club to showcase teams, manage registrations, and engage parents, players, and external teams in central Kansas. Features include team schedules, tournament signups, merchandise sales, a Coaches Corner with AI-generated resources, and a Parent Portal, all with a sporty, cutting-edge, minimalistic dark theme.

**Tech Stack**:

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (auth, PostgreSQL, storage)
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Fulfillment**: Printful (print-on-demand for t-shirts)
- **UI Libraries**: Swiper.js (carousel), FullCalendar (schedules)
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Development**: Cursor (AI code editor)
- **Email**: Resend (transactional emails)

**Design**:

- Dark theme matching the club's logo
- **Primary Colors**: Navy (#1C2526), white (#FFFFFF), red (#D91E18)
- **Font**: Rubik (body), Inter (headings)
- **Layout**: Clean, minimalistic, with bold CTAs and card-based sections
- **Usability**: User-friendly for parents (register, view schedules, buy t-shirts), external teams (tournament signups), and coaches (update schedules), with a simple journey: explore club, register, manage team info.

**Cost Goal**: Minimal, leveraging free tiers (Supabase: 500 MB database, Vercel: Hobby plan, Stripe/Printful: pay-per-use, Resend: 100 emails/day) and open-source tools. Target budget: $20â€“$30/month.

**Documentation**: This file tracks progress, tasks, errors, and rules, shared with Grok in new conversation windows to maintain continuity across multi-session development in /salina-youth-basketball.

## Current State

**Date**: May 24, 2025, 10:05 AM CDT

**Progress**: Advanced Phase 3: Build Website. Completed the About page (`/app/about/page.tsx`) with the main logo (`/images/WCS Logo-transparentBG.png`), mission statement, and a fictitious history, styled with a dark theme (`bg-[#002C51]`, `bg-gray-900` cards, `border-red-500/50`, Rubik/Inter fonts). Updated the Navbar (`/src/components/common/Navbar.tsx`) to include an About link in desktop and mobile menus. Deployed the updated site to Vercel at `https://wcs-three.vercel.app`. In progress with the Tournaments page (`/app/tournaments/page.tsx`), which includes static tournament listings, a signup form with Supabase storage, and a TourneyMachine link, with styling adjustments ongoing. Phase 4 (Testing and Deployment) is in progress, with deployment complete and initial testing of the Shop page, Values section, Coaches Corner section, and About page successful. Next tasks: Refine the Navbar, complete the Tournaments page, fix redirect error on `/join/status`, test Resend email delivery, and continue end-to-end testing of all flows (registration, schedules, purchases).

**Blockers**: None.

**Errors**:

- [May 16, 2025]: No errors during Schedules page implementation. Fixed earlier FullCalendar CSS import issues by importing `main.css` in `/src/app/global.css`. Resolved mobile text overflow by hiding text in Month view and using colored blocks.
- [May 17, 2025]: Fixed `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` for merchandise images in `/app/teams/[id]/page.tsx` by correcting paths (e.g., `/images/team-thunderhawks-merch.jpg`).
- [May 17, 2025]: Resolved build errors: ESLint (`Cannot find package 'typescript-eslint'`) by installing `@typescript-eslint/parser` and `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`; TypeScript error in `/app/schedules/page.ts` by moving `events` and `teams` to `/src/lib/schedules/data.ts`.
- [May 18, 2025]: Fixed ESLint error (`Cannot find package 'eslint-plugin-styled-jsx'`) by removing the plugin from `eslint.config.mjs`, as Tailwind CSS is used instead of Styled JSX.
- [May 18, 2025]: Resolved build errors: `localStorage is not defined` in `/app/shop/cart/page.tsx` by moving `localStorage` access to `useEffect`; `useSearchParams` suspense error in `/app/shop/confirmation/page.tsx` by adding `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`; `metadataBase` warning by adding it to `/src/app/layout.tsx`.
- [May 19, 2025]: Resolved Printful API integration errors: `Property 'source' is required` by adding `source: "api"` to the payload and updating the endpoint to `/orders` (removing `/v2`); `There can only be one file for each placement` by sending a single file in the `files` array; missing API keys by setting `PRINTFUL_TEST_API_KEY` and `PRINTFUL_API_KEY` in Vercel; incorrect test mode logic by updating `isTestMode` to rely solely on `searchParams` in `/app/shop/checkout/CheckoutPage.tsx`.
- [May 20, 2025]: Fixed Printful order confirmation error: 404 on `/v2/orders/@confirm` by updating to the correct endpoint `/orders/{id}/confirm` in `/pages/api/create-printful-order.ts`. Resolved client-side error ("contact support") by ensuring the server handles confirmation failures gracefully and the client receives the correct response.
- [May 22, 2025]: No errors during Values section updates. Successfully implemented simplified carousel, responsive text alignment, shaded box, modal outside click, and single-line mobile section title.
- [May 23, 2025]: Fixed CSV import issue for `drills` table by correcting array format for `skills` and `equipment` columns, successfully loaded 26 drills into Supabase. No errors during Coaches Corner section updates (dynamic drill fetching, image handling, accordion styling).
- [May 24, 2025]: No errors during About page implementation. Successfully created `/app/about/page.tsx` with logo, mission statement, and history, and updated `/src/components/common/Navbar.tsx` to include About link.

## Prompts

### Start New Conversation with Grok

Hi Grok, I'm continuing work on the Salina Youth Basketball Club website in a new conversation window. Please review the attached PROGRESS.md file for the project's context, progress, and tasks. The site is a mobile-first, custom-built web app for managing youth basketball teams, using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Stripe, Printful, Resend, Vercel, and Cursor. The design is a dark theme (navy #1C2526, white #FFFFFF, red #D91E18; Rubik/Inter fonts), with a sporty, minimalistic layout for parents, teams, and coaches.

PROGRESS.md Contents:

[See attached PROGRESS.md]

Current Task:

[Insert current task here, e.g., refining the Navbar or completing the Tournaments page.]

Additional Context:

- The Shop page uses Stripe for payments (`/pages/api/stripe-payment.ts`) and Resend for emails (`/pages/api/send-email.ts`).
- Orders are confirmed in `/app/shop/confirmation/page.tsx` with data like `items` (productId, variantId, size, color, quantity), `subtotal`, `shippingCost`, `totalPrice`, and `shippingAddress` (fullName, street, city, state, zip, country).
- Printful handles t-shirt fulfillment (e.g., `/images/team-thunderhawks-merch.jpg` products).
- Refer to Printful API Docs (https://www.printful.com/api) for endpoints and authentication.
- Use cost-minimal approaches (e.g., Printfulâ€™s pay-per-use model).
- Style any new UI (e.g., error messages) to match the dark theme (`bg-[#002C51]`, `bg-gray-900` cards, `bg-blue-600` buttons).
- Update `PROGRESS.md` with task completion and status after each response.
- Ensure compliance with `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (e.g., `styling-rules.mdc` for Tailwind).

Please provide a detailed plan for the current task, then proceed with implementing necessary code. Let me know if you need specific files or clarification.
