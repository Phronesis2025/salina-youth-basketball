# Supabase Rules for Cursor
- Initialize Supabase client in `/lib/supabase.ts`.
- Fetch data server-side with `getServerSideProps` for SEO.
- Use Supabase Auth for Parent Portal and coach dashboard.
- Log errors for failed queries (e.g., console.log) but donâ€™t display to users.

- Cache frequent queries (e.g., team list) with Next.js `revalidate`.
