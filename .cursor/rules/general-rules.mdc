# General Rules for Cursor
- Use TypeScript for all files (`*.tsx`).
- Name components in PascalCase (e.g., `TeamCard.tsx`).
- Use functional components with React hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`).
- Handle errors with try-catch for Supabase/Stripe API calls.

- Write unit tests for components using Jest.
